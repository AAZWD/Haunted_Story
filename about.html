        <div class="content">"The Story So Far" is a visually engaging and interactive form of live storytelling, 
            that allows visitors to direct their own story. "The Story So Far" is stylized after the personal blog 
            of a fictional character (the blogger) that believes in a supernatural haunting. She will use the blog 
            to document multiple visits to a haunted house on the outskirts of her city, with the hopes of solving the
            mystery behind the house's haunting.
            <br><br>
            Users will get the chance to ‘interact’ with the character by submitting suggestions for what she should do 
            next in her investigation. Our paranormal investigator will upload video, and recordings of what she finds to
            describe the mysteries she encounters as well as her own drawings. Sign up now to take part in this digital 
            <i>Chose Your Own Adventure Story</i>!
